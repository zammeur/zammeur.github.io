			<h1>Disclaimer</h1>
			<h3 style="width:50%">We’ve been conducting this analysis for several weeks. All the data we used comes from trusted, reliable and open sources (TDCJ and DPIC1). The study starts in 1972 and is focused on the death penalty landscape in the United States of America. We tried not to take sides for or against death penalty. Our ambition was to shed light on that controversial, sometimes distorted topic, thanks to thorough data-driven methodology.

			  <font> Love and family </font>: as families often attend the executions, defendants talk to them: “to my mother and my family, I love you”
			  <font> Peace and forgiveness </font>: “I want to say I’m sorry for the pain I’ve caused you people. I’m sorry I can’t bring everybody back.”

		<h3>Death-row inmates often fight for years to push the Court to withdraw the capital sentence. This process is rarely successful, it gives them more time, at most.

		<h3>America’s opinion on death penalty has always been grounds for division. Republicans tend to support it while Democrats put efforts to end it. Although the latter is at its highest levels since 1972, opponents of death penalty have always been in minority (41% in 2017). The opposition to death penalty is consistent with the number of executions per year. We shall note that death penalty sees a growing support in the 90s while the number of executions increase accordingly.  Since then, both figures follow a declining trend. </h3>
